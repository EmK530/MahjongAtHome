# MahjongAtHome
Recreation of the base API for Mahjong Fight Girl.<br>
This will be open-sourced when CPU games are functional.

## How to test
Download the [testing plugin](https://github.com/EmK530/MahjongAtHome/releases/tag/asphyxia-only) for Asphyxia CORE.<br>
This does not manage the game but rather point you to my testing server.

## Current status
- Boots to main menu, data saves but game does not acknowledge it, could be from lack of playing a full game<br>
- Only CPU games are allowed at the moment, gets stuck after the casting intro<br>
- Gacha button is greyed out, fixing it is currently not prioritized but rather making a CPU game work.
