# MahjongAtHome
This project is currently closed-source, come back later.

## Current status
- Boots to main menu, data saves but game does not acknowledge it, could be from lack of playing a full game<br>
- Any gamemode causes Network Malfunction 5-2600-0000 after failed connections to /gget<br>
- Gacha button is greyed out, fixing it is currently not prioritized but rather making a CPU game work.
